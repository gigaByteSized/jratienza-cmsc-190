Public transportation is a leading mode of transportation in the Philippines, yet the public transportation system has often been criticized for lagging behind the standards of developed countries. There is a lack of travel applications specifically tailored for public transportation assistance, and the current choices are limited and have limitations.

The goal of this paper is to develop the basis of a 'commuter first' multimodal trip planning travel companion for mobile devices that commuters can use on demand and anywhere. This is especially important for first-time commuters to an area. Similarly, community-driven input is also important in molding a standardized transit feed dataset. To leverage this need, the application will give users the power to request the creation and modification of routes.

This project has the potential to improve the Quality of Life (QoL) of many commuters, especially those who are first-time commuters to a certain place. It can also help commuters be aware of traffic congestions and make the proper decisions in exploring other possible and more efficient routes.
